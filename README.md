## V. Insight
### 1. Summary
**General Business situation:** 
* In general, revenue tended to increase steadily from 2011 to the end of 2014 with a profit margin of 11.61%. In each year, revenue tends to increase steadily in all categories (category).
* However, in each year, revenue tended to increase steadily in all categories (category) until the fourth quarter and then fell sharply in the first quarter of the following year.
* The individual customer group is the group that brings in the main revenue for the company 51%, Enterprise 30% and Home Office 18%.
* The total profit YoY and revenue YoY are both reported as positive with 52.35% and 51.55% respectively, which means that the company or investment portfolio has experienced significant growth in both its profitability and revenue over the past year compared to the previous year.

**Market:** 
* APAC (3.59 million, accounting for 28.36%), EU (2.94 million, accounting for 23.24%) and the US (2.3 million, accounting for 18.17%) are the 3 markets with the most revenue. The proportion between the three categories is evenly distributed in most markets, but Technology products still account for the largest proportion.
The top 3 countries with the highest revenue and profits are the United States, China and India, respectively. 

**Product:**
* Top 1 product that has the highest profit is Canon ImageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier, especially since this product is created only in the USA in the top 10 countries by profit and revenue.
* Top 5 sub-categories brought the biggest revenue: Phones (1.7M), Copiers (1.5M), Chairs (1.5M), Bookcases (1.4M), and Storage (1.2M)

### 2. Recommodation
Continue to consider expanding into the APAC, EU, and US markets:
*  In the APAC market, focus on China and India, which bring in high revenue. Concentrate on industries such as Technology and Furniture.
*  In the EU market, focus on the United Kingdom and Germany and industries such as Technology and Office Supplies. Unlike APAC, the Furniture industry does not generate much revenue here.

The company should strongly promote sales and marketing strategies on potential products such as phones, photocopiers, bookcases, chairs, and accessories. These are potential products in the top 10 products that bring high revenue to the company
